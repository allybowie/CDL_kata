## A checkout system created using Javascript, tested using Jest and with the user interface built using React.

#### All the data is local and the functionality to add and remove items to the basket has been included. The interface includes a list of products with buttons (+ and -) to add and remove items from the basket, and a basket which is shown at the side of the screen, showing different line items that have been added and their quantity. The React app is also responsive so that content is also easily visible on mobile devices.

## Start React App
#### npm i
#### npm run start

## Run Tests Using Jest
